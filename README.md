# OCR Field Extraction Tool

This application helps extract specific fields from OCR results generated by PaddleOCR. It currently extracts:

1. Recipe field value (e.g., "IP PR")
2. BadgeNo. field value (e.g., "SV2-250113-0370")
3. Table data with columns: CBS Type, Min, Max, Count

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- tkinter (included in standard Python distribution)

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python ocr_extraction_gui.py
   ```

2. Click "Browse" to select a JSON file containing OCR results

3. Click "Extract Fields" to process the file and extract the required information

4. The extracted data will be displayed in the UI:
   - Recipe and BadgeNo. fields at the top
   - Table data in the grid below

5. Click "Export Results" to save the extracted data to a JSON file

## Extraction Logic

The application uses multiple strategies to extract the required fields:

- Regular expression patterns to find field labels and their associated values
- Position-based extraction using the OCR text blocks
- Fallback methods for edge cases

If a field cannot be extracted, it will display "Not found" in the UI.

## Example

When using the example_res.json file, the application should extract:
- Recipe: "IP PR"
- BadgeNo.: "SV2-250113-0370"
- Table data with CBS Type, Min, Max, and Count values

## Troubleshooting

If the application fails to extract data correctly:
1. Check that the input JSON has the expected structure
2. Verify the OCR results contain the fields you're looking for
3. You may need to adjust the extraction patterns in the source code for different document formats
